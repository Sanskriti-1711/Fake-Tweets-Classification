# Fake-Tweets-Classification
In this report, we endeavor to tackle the pressing issue of classifying posts within the
MediaEval 2015 ”verifying multimedia use” dataset, aiming to discern between genuine
and deceptive content. The task involves designing three distinct pipelines using
Machine Learning Algorithms(KNN, Random Forest, SVM). The data pipeline
incorporates essential pre-processing steps, feature selection methods, and
dimensionality reduction techniques to optimize the models’ efficiency. We train each
algorithm and evaluate its performance in distinguishing real from fake posts using
various metrics like accuracy and F1-score. This project endeavours to contribute to the
field of multimedia content verification by implementing robust Machine Learning
solutions tailored to the complexities of the provided dataset.
